MecanumCraft Hub is a project uniting robotics and app development. It features a GUI program connecting to a microcontroller through WiFi or Bluetooth, enabling users to control a mecanum car via soft joysticks or a connected gamepad. The second part focuses on mecanum wheel movement logic, allowing the car to move effortlessly in any direction.

## Features:

The application offers a range of features designed to provide users with a customizable and precise control experience:

- **Live Input Display:**
  Users can observe real-time input from the gamepad and soft joysticks, ensuring an interactive and dynamic control experience.

- **Direct Terminal:**
  The inclusion of a direct terminal allows users to input text directly, facilitating communication with the microcontroller. This terminal is a valuable tool for debugging purposes, supporting both the sending and receiving of data.

- **IP Address Configuration (WiFi):**
  For users opting for WiFi connectivity, the application provides the flexibility to set the IP address, allowing seamless communication with the microcontroller over a local network.

- **Joystick Precision Adjustment:**
  The application caters to user preferences by offering the option to choose the rounding of joystick values. This feature enables users to fine-tune the precision of control, allowing for a tailored and responsive experience.

These features collectively contribute to a versatile and user-centric application, ensuring adaptability to various control preferences and scenarios.
